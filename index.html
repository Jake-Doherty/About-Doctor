            <p>
                My cat Doctor has been a welcome companion for the last 9 years, and soon celebrates
                his 10th birthday in October! He is a black and white piebald with a very fetching
                'Phantom of the Opera' mask. Doctor has a brother named "Chicken Man" and a sister
                named "Penny". They tolerate each other. Doctor has lived his life indoors for the
                most part, but enjoyed a brief period as a farm cat while I lived with my parents.

            <ul>
                <li>He LOVES his catnip first thing in the morning</li>
                <li>He was rescued when he was only about 4 weeks old</li>
                <li>He is very fond of ear rubs, and will thank you kindly for them.</li>
